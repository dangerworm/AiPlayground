# User Story 3

As a user
I want to interact with characters
So that I can see the differences between them

Accceptance Criteria 1:

Given that I am a user on the system
When I click on the coloured ball representing the character
Then I am presented with a drawer containing settings for the character
And I can see the chat history representing its internal monologue
